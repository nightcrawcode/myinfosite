  <p>Yes i am making changed for mac. i am working on a prototype and should be ready by the time when i go back to school. I hope this works out well. one thing i did notice is when i shared a preview to people (just a video) they said to make sure to only let people who own the game. problem is i need a way to check on steam servers without making it look like a scam. email me if you have something please. but overall it is 1:1 remake for mac users (and maybe linux)</p>
