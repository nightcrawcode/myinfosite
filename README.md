# Drwhomust's Website
This is my website to leave links to stuff, have a blog, and have fun little stuff around.
and also i want to use this to showcase my projects in one place! and i want to make it
a 90s like website because websites from that time looked so cool. plus it even shows how
much i like using old tech! but overall this is my website about me for people to learn more about me!

this website was made in mircosoft word some-how. (i am not kidding, word can save docs in html files)

# Can I copy the website
Yes please do. the reason why i want people to use my website's code is to help them learn how to code.
making this website was really hard for me because word did not like me and editing the html was very hard as well.
and i want to use this website as an exsample or a base for people to work off of. and just learn how things work
around the web and just programming in gernal. i don't care if you leave credit or not i just want people to know
how to code even if it is just a hello world.

# Is this real?
Yep! this is my offical website for everything i do on the web. if you don't belive me, just check the links on
some of my socials and most of them will have a link to this website or the repo (aka the github page you are reading this from...
or in your code editor if you forked this project)

# Where can I visit it?
I will try to put links of it on every social media account I have.
but you can visit it [here](https://nightcrawcode.github.io/myinfosite/) as well.

and also the offical website of **Drwhomust** will always be hosted on Github.

there was a point i wanted to use neocitys but i picked github because it made it easy to edit the code (because it would show up in my code
editor) and depoly the website on github pages. plus i like having my username under a github domain. it makes it feel *special*
